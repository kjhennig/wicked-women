(the *'s represent a personal repeating trait.  I envision this as a sniff, 
or a "tsk" sound that is a habit for the character.  It is up to the actor to 
devise what works for her)


Hansel and Gretel

*    .... *   ....... *...

*

Well I don't know why you're sitting there like that, just looking at me
 *
I have absolutely nothing to say.
*
nothing.
*
A woman of my age, here, *
It's unheard of.  It really is.  Attempted murder .. so stupid, so very, very 
stupid.
*
I mean, it's not as if there weren't signs, clear for all to see.
"Please do not eat the gingerbread"
"Trespassers will be roasted" 

And not just one or two - all around.   You go back to the forest and see - 
they're everywhere

Of course, with all the publicity this trial has generated there probably 
aren't any left.  Souvenir hunters will have taken them.  The whole cottage has 
probably been eaten by now.

Years in the confectionery business, the victim of petty larceny and vandalism 
and I end up in prison .. I tell you, there is absolutely no justice in the 
world.
*

Oh yes, my family had a little bakery in the east; I grew up with the smell of 
yeast in my nostrils.  

Father had a way with fruit bread that was unbelievable.  He and mother worked 
all day.  Up early in the morning to set the loaves, serving all day in the 
shop and then mixing special icings and cleaning the place all evening.  The 
whole family was a slave to the business.

I was best at gingerbread, wafers, cookies that sort of things.  Always had a 
way with sweets.  A girl made of sugar and spice, that was me.
*
*
Of course, mother and father didn't often let me serve behind the counter. * I 
just don't have a way with people.  The stupid things they ask ..
"is this bread fresh?"
"any egg and milk in this?  I can't eat eggs"

"then don't come into the shop" I'd tell them, 

Mother said I turned custom away. *

After they passed I did try to make a go of it on my own but it's too much work 
for one person and I really don't like being among people.
*
So I took a big breath, surveyed my assets and decided it would be best if I 
just moved away and spent my last days in solitude, enjoying the peace.

*
*
Of course, at first I didn't think I'd be able to afford it.  Have you SEEN the 
price of lumber these days?  But I don't have a way with gingerbread and icings 
for nothing.   

A bit of experimentation and I had a perfectly fine place that could withstand 
even the worst of the winter storms.
You don't know the bliss, after years of being at the beck and call of the 
public, to finally have a place where I could do as I liked.
*
I chose a place far, far off the trails.  Was perfectly happy by myself, in my 
cozy little house.
*....... *
Of course. when this new fad of hiking started I had a premonition that things 
were going to turn out badly.  A few odd people would stumble across the 
cottage from time to time, but I could usually scare them away.
I kept an odd looking stick and a frightful hat by the door just in case.*  I'd 
barge out of the door waving one and wearing the other and look as threatening 
as possible.
*
*
really, it was demeaning, but it was all I could think of.  Well, I could have 
used magic .. you don't bake all your life without picking up a bit of magic 
.... but whenever I cast a spell I have a headache for weeks.  Probably some 
sort of allergy to Latin.  Most of the spells I know use Latin.
*
One year I had a bad scare.  This cocky young thing arrives and tells me with 
pride that he is a researcher for something called the Lonely Planet and he'd 
like to include me in the latest addition.

"People from all over the world will be coming to your door" he says.
*
well, I really had no choice, did I?
*
I turned him into a frog. * He's probably still somewhere near the well - I 
lost track of him.  If you visit the place, he's the one with the perpetually 
surprised look on his face.  Green.  You can't miss him.
*
I had to take Zomig for weeks afterward .... my head was splitting.
*
*
You know what's been so unfair about all of this?  No one has even investigated 
the parents.

No one has questioned the fact that they left those children in the woods not 
once, but twice.  

No one has considered how difficult it is to be perpetually repairing the 
gingerbread those two were eating.  Look at me, do I look like the kind of 
person who should be on a roof, replacing shingles?  At my age?  And I'm on a 
fixed income.  It's not as if Royal Icing is cheap to make.
*
Look, you may as well just go away, I said I didn't want to talk.
*
really, no comment,
*
no comment at all

*....   *
