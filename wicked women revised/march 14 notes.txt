2. 	Where will you hang out at intermission?  do you all want costume room 
or some in kitchen?

3.  	Today - lighting finalization - I can start thinking about other things
	- make up, final costume things, details
	- deck people on head set
	- Gayle will give clears
	- start to work out if deck people giving gos will work.
	IF YOU ARE NOT INVOVLED IN THE NEXT CHANGE AND NOT ON - DO NOT BE 
BACKSTAGE
	- bs people, some actors need reminders for what they do in changes
	- who will play Meredith for changes? Debbie?  Spencer?
	- after rehearsal - Gayle and K cue book, clear prop area of everything 
we don't need
	- Sharon, please read Meredeth

ACTORS - please give Debbie final notes on props needed - REAL props (i.e. 
Anastasia real dust rag)
