Welcome to Wicked Ways Anonymous, a fellowship of characters who share their 
experience, strength and hope  that they may solve their common problems and 
help others to recover from wickedness. The only requirement for membership is 
a desire to stop being wicked. 

Though you are here due to court mandate or community intervention  we know 
that our 12 step program will help you embrace the good ways of the world.  

Meetings start next week.  This week, in preparation, you are required to spend 
time with your inner self.  To list those you have harmed to make amends, to 
take a personal inventory, and work hard to become the good person who is 
trapped inside you.

"hi" you will say, "my name is ..... and I"m wicked"  

It is as simple as that.  Congratulations, you have just taken a first step to 
goodness.

See you all next week.
