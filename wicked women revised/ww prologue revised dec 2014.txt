Characters enter singley into a space not known to them.  They see and but 
not engage with the others in the room, though each of them carves out their 
own space.

when all have entered a light or some other indicator brings their attention to 
a basket of envelopes.  Each has one character name on it.

The characters take their envelope, and together open them - the letters are 
read out loud, each character taking a line.

You have been identififed 
as a wicked woman 
(wolf) 
and may be called  
to account for all you have done. 
 
You are hereby directed  and instructed 
to review your lives and to 
contemplate the consequences of your choices.

Resolute and purposeful reflection must be your goal. 
An honest appraisal of the harm you have brought to others.

You may be called upon
at any time in the future
to answer for the wickedness you have wrought.

Each character reacts in their own way, and, taking the letter, exits, leaving 
only Anastasia on stage to begin her monologue
