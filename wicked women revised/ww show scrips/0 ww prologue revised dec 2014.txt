Wicked Women and One Lone Wolf

by Karla Hennig (2015)

Characters enter singly into a space not known to them.  They see and but not 
engage with the others in the room, though each of them carves out their own 
space.

when all have entered a light or some other indicator brings their attention to 
a basket of envelopes.  Each has one character name on it.

The characters take their envelope, and together open them - the letters are 
read out loud, each character taking a line.

Magda - You have been identififed 
Delilah - as a wicked woman 
Wolfgang - (wolf) 
Carabosse - and may be called  
Lilith - to account for all you have done. 
 
Ethel - You are hereby directed  and instructed 
Meredith - to review your lives and to 
Brangomar - contemplate the consequences of your choices.

Wolfgang - Resolute and purposeful reflection must be your goal. 
Gingema - An honest appraisal of the harm you have brought to others.

Anastasia - You may be called upon at any time in the future
Carolyn - to answer for the wickedness you have wrought.

Each character reacts in their own way, and, taking the letter, exits, leaving 
only Anastasia on stage to begin her monologue
