Magda (Hansel and Gretel) revised December 2014

(the *'s represent a personal repeating trait.  I envision this as a sniff, or 
a "tsk" sound that is a habit for the character.  It is up to the actor to 
devise what works for her)


*    ....    Magda .. Magda of the forest  *   ....... *...

I bake houses of gingerbread, beautiful houses and sometimes

*

Sometimes I roast children

* .... *

Well I do not know why you are sitting there like that, just looking at me
 *
I have absolutely nothing to say.
*
nothing.
*
A woman of my age, here, *
It is unheard of.   Attempted murder .. so stupid, so very, very stupid.
*
Iit is not as if there were not signs, clear for all to see.
"Please do not eat the gingerbreads"
"Trespassers will be roasted" 

And not just one or two -  all round.   You go back to the forest and see - 
they are everywhere

Ahhhh .... with all the publicity this trial has generated there are probably 
none left.  Souvenir hunters will have taken them.  The whole cottage has 
probably been eaten by now.

Years in the confectionery business, the victim of petty larceny and vandalism 
and I end up in prison .. there is  no justice in the world.
*

Oh yes, my family had a little bakery in the east; I grew up with the smell of 
yeast in my nostrils.  

Father had a way with fruit bread that was unbelievable.  He and mother worked 
all day.  Up early in the morning to set the loaves, serving all day in the 
shop and then mixing special icings and cleaning all evening.  The whole family 
a slave to the business.

I was best at gingerbread, wafers, cookies that sort of things.  Always had a 
way with sweets.  A girl made of sugar and spice, that was me.
*
*
Of course, mother and father did not often let me serve behind the counter. * I 
just do not have a way with people.  The stupid things they ask ..
"is this bread fresh?"
"any egg and milk in this?  I can not eat eggs"

"then do not come into the shop" I would tell them, 

Mother said I turned custom away. *

After they passed I did try to make a go of it on my own but it is too much 
work for one person and I really do nott like being with people.
*
So I took a big breath, looked at my assets and decided it would be best if I 
moved away and spent my last days in solitude, enjoying the peace.

*
*
Of course, at first I did not think I would be able to afford it.  Have you 
SEEN the price of lumber these days?  But I do not have a way with gingerbread 
and icings for nothing.   

A few trials here and there and I had a perfectly fine place that could 
withstand even the worst of the winter storms.

You do not know the bliss, after years of being at the call of the public, to 
have a place where I could do as I liked.
*
I chose a place far, far off the trails.  Was perfectly happy by myself, in my 
cozy little house.
*....... *
Of course. when this new fad of hiking started I had a premonition that things 
were going to turn out badly.  A few odd or sporty people would stumble across 
the cottage from time to time, but I could usually scare them away.  I would 
pretend to be a witch!  I kept an odd looking stick and a frightful hat by the 
door just in case.*  I would barge out of the door waving one and wearing the 
other and look very mean.
*
*
really, it was demeaning, but it was all I could think of.  Well, I could have 
used magic .. you do not bake all your life without picking up a bit of magic 
.... but whenever I cast a spell I have a headache for weeks.  Probably some 
sort of allergy to Latin.  Most of the spells I know use Latin.
*
One year I had a bad scare.  This cocky young thing arrives and tells me with 
pride that he is a researcher for something called the Lonely Planet and he 
could include me in the latest addition.

"People from all over the world will be coming to your door" he says. “you 
could open a tea shop, make a little money.”
*
well, I really had no choice, did I?
*
I turned him into a frog. * 

He is probably still somewhere near the well - I lost track of him.  If you 
visit the cottage, he will be the frog with the perpetually surprised look on 
his face.  Green.  You can not miss him.
*
I had to take Zomig for weeks afterward .... my head was splitting.
*
*
You know what is so unfair about all of this?  No one has even investigated the 
parents.

No one has questioned the fact that they left those children in the woods not 
once, but twice.  

No one has considered how difficult it is to be always repairing the 
gingerbread those two were eating.  Look at me, do I look like the kind of 
person who should be on a roof, replacing shingles?  At my age?  And I am on a 
fixed income.  It is not as if Royal Icing is cheap to make.
*
Look, you may as well just go away, I said I did not want to talk.
*
really, no comment,
*
no comment at all

*....   *
