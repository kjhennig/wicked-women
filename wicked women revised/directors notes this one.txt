Three years ago I awoke at 3 a.m. with Anastasia's complete story in my 
head; hers was the first 

monologue to emerge during of a flurry of early morning writings. Three play 
readings, 

innumerable cups of tea with friends and one play workshop later, Wicked Women 
and One 

Lone Wolf has finally been birthed. My thanks to the many midwives who have 
been with me 

along the way. 


Thanks to those who have allowed me to steal their suggestions, their names, 
their 

personal stories and their quirks to give to my characters. 


Thanks to the gracious few who listened to me read my play over and over and 
over, to those 

who workshopped the characters and patiently allowed me to tinker with sentence 
order and tiny 

word changes. 


Thanks to the actors in this production who have helped me to hone each idea 
and have taught 

me that characters have a life of their own and make decisions I would never 
have envisioned as 

I saw the words on the page – what gifts you have given me!.



Though many people have been involved in the evolution of this play, I 
particularly want to 

thank Nancy Stone Archer, Marianne Brorup Weston, Jo Anne Voogd, Dina von 

Hahn and Kristen Hennig for their insight, support and inspiration. Your 
dedication to this 

project and your encouragement have been invaluable. 


As opening night draws near the stories take on a life of their own; no longer 
"my play" but a 

production which grew and changed through the commitment and skills of its cast 
and crew. 

We offer it to you, the audience, in the hope that you will enter into the 
delight 

and excitement which it first inspired.


I am overjoyed to see it be born; I release it into the world confident that it 
will 

enjoy a wonderful life.

And

I turn to the many unfinished plays in my files and itch to begin anew .....
