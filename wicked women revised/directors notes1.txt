Three years ago I awoke at 3 a.m. with Anastasia's complete story in my head; 
hers was the first monologue to emerge during of a flurry of early morning 
writings. Three play readings, innumerable cups of tea with friends and one 
play workshop later, Wicked Women and One Lone Wolf has finally been birthed. 
Many thanks to the midwives who assisted along the way. 
Thanks to those who allowed their suggestions, their names, their personal 
stories and their quirks to be given to the characters. 
Thanks to the gracious few who listened to the play being read over and over 
and over, to those who workshopped the characters and patiently allowed me to 
tinker with sentence order and tiny word changes. 
Thanks to the actors in this production who have helped to hone each idea and 
who constructed  characters never envisioned when they merely sat as words 
upon the page – what gifts you have given me!
Though many people have been involved in the evolution of this work, I 
particularly want to thank Nancy Stone Archer, Marianne Brorup Weston, Jo Anne 
Voogd, Dina von Hahn and Kristen Hennig for their insight, support and 
inspiration. Your dedication to this  project and your encouragement have been 
invaluable. 
As opening night draws near the stories take on a life of their own; no longer 
"my play" but a production which grew and changed through the commitment and 
skills of its cast and crew. 
We offer it to you, the audience, in the hope you will enter into the delight 
and excitement which it first inspired.
I am overjoyed to see it be born; I release it into the world confident that it 
will enjoy a wonderful life. And I turn to the many unfinished plays in my 
files and itch to begin anew .....
