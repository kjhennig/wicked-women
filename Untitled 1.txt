Delilah by Meera Lester
Delilah was another biblical beauty who showed how a pretty woman could bring 
down a man, even if he was a powerhouse of strength. She lived in the valley of 
Sorek, and may have been a widow, for she had means to live without a husband. 
The Bible does not reveal her lineage, whether Israelite, Philistine, or 
something else, and does not say Delilah loved Samson, hero of the Israelites. 
It does say that she became the object of Samson's desire after he had been 
betrayed by his Philistine wife. His enemies must have thought that they could 
exploit Samson's weakness for her. The lords of the Philistines approached 
Delilah with an extraordinary offer of 1,100 pieces of silver per man if she 
would discover for them the source of Samson's strength, and how he could be 
bound so as not to break free. Was Delilah coerced into betraying Samson? Was 
she loyal to the Philistines? Did she desire the money? The Scripture does not 
reveal Delilah's motivation, but does recount the steps in her betrayal. Three 
times she asked Samson about what could bind him that he could not break, and 
three times he told her a lie. Delilah pressed him daily for the answer to that 
question, but Samson resisted.
Before Samson was born, an angel appeared to his mother and foretold his birth. 
The angel warned her not to drink wine or strong drink, and not to eat anything 
unclean, “for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day 
of his death” (Judges 13:7). In other words, the child would be consecrated 
to God. Samson grew up blessed with extraordinary powers, including strength, 
but only if his hair was never cut. Before he met Delilah, he had a fondness 
for Philistine women, one in particular. She was a woman from Timnath, and 
Samson demanded his parents get her for him.
Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the 
daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a 
wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her 
for me; for she pleaseth me well. (Judges 14:3)
Samson's father made the arrangements for Samson to marry the woman (unnamed in 
the Bible). During the engagement feast, Samson made a wager with some young 
Philistine men, telling them a riddle that they would have to solve within 
seven days in order to get thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments. Upset 
that they could not solve the riddle, the men went to the young bride-to-be and 
asked her to get Samson to reveal the riddle. They threatened to burn her and 
her father's house if she didn't get it for them. She wept and asked Samson to 
reveal it. He held off for most of the week, but on the seventh day gave in, 
broke his Nazarite vow, and shared it with her. She, in turn, gave it to the 
Philistines. Enraged, Samson murdered thirty Philistine men and his wife was 
given to his companion.
Tradition paints Delilah as a fallen woman and a deceiver, but some scholars 
say that the image is not supported by the Scriptures. She didn't lie to Samson 
or trick him with her words. On the contrary, she asked quite directly: “Tell 
me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest 
be bound to afflict thee” (Judges 16:6). It was Samson who repeatedly lied.
Samson then met Deliliah and loved her. He told Delilah that if he were tied 
with seven green withes or new ropes or seven locks of his hair woven with the 
web, that he would not be able to break free. Delilah put him to the test, and 
each time Samson broke the restraints. She protested and asked him how he could 
possibly love her when he continued to mock her with lies. Samson finally 
poured out his heart to Delilah. He confessed that a razor had never touched 
his head. If his hair were cut, he would lose his strength. Delilah wasted no 
time summoning the Philistines.
Delilah placed Samson's head in her lap and lulled him to sleep. She then 
summoned a man to cut Samson's hair. With his locks shorn, Samson's vow to God 
was broken. The Philistines bound him and gouged out his eyes. In the ultimate 
humiliation, Samson was put to work in prison pounding grain, the task of a 
woman.

After betraying Samson, Delilah disappeared from the story, although some 
scholars suggest that she may have been present during the Philistine 
agricultural festival at the Temple of Dagon where Samson was brought out so 
all could see the vanquished hero of the Israelites. In that version of the 
story, what no one seemed to have noticed was that Samson's hair had started 
growing again. After calling upon the Lord to strengthen him, Samson put his 
hands upon the pillars of the temple and pulled the structure down, killing 
himself and 3,000 Philistines, and Delilah, too, if she were present that day 
to see the culmination of her deed.
Samson's activity takes place during a time when God was punishing the 
Israelites, by giving them "into the hand of the Philistines".[12] An angel 
appears to Manoah, an Israelite from the tribe of Dan, in the city of Zorah, 
and to his wife, who had been unable to conceive.[3][6][13] This angel 
proclaims that the couple will soon have a son who will begin to deliver the 
Israelites from the Philistines.[6] The wife believed the angel, but her 
husband wasn't present, at first, and wanted the heavenly messenger to return, 
asking that he himself could also receive instruction about the child that was 
going to be born.
Requirements were set up by the angel that Manoah's wife (as well as the child) 
were to abstain from all alcoholic beverages, and her promised child was not to 
shave or cut his hair. He was to be a "Nazirite" from birth. In ancient Israel, 
those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a while could take a 
nazarite vow, which included things like the aforementioned as well as other 
stipulations.[3][6][13] After the angel returned, Manoah soon prepared a 
sacrifice, but the Messenger would only allow it to be for God, touching his 
staff to it, miraculously engulfing it in flames. The angel then ascended up 
into the sky in the fire. This was such dramatic evidence as to the nature of 
the messenger, that Manoah feared for his life, as it has been said that no-one 
can live after seeing God; however, his wife soon convinced him that if God 
planned to slay them, he would never have revealed such things to them to begin 
with. In due time the son, Samson, is born; he is reared according to these 
provisions.[6][13]

When he becomes a young adult, Samson leaves the hills of his people to see the 
cities of the Philistines. While there, Samson falls in love with a Philistine 
woman from Timnah whom he decides to marry, overcoming the objections of his 
parents who do not know that "it is of the Lord".[6][13][14] The intended 
marriage is actually part of God's plan to strike at the Philistines.[6] On the 
way to ask for the woman's hand in marriage, Samson is attacked by an Asiatic 
Lion and simply grabs it and rips it apart, as the spirit of God moves upon 
him, divinely empowering him. This so profoundly affects Samson that he just 
keeps it to himself as a secret.[6][7] He continues on to the Philistine's 
house, winning her hand in marriage. On his way to the wedding, Samson notices 
that bees have nested in the carcass of the lion and have made honey.[6][7] He 
eats a handful of the honey and gives some to his parents.[6] At the 
wedding-feast, Samson proposes that he tell a riddle to his thirty groomsmen 
(all Philistines); if they can solve it, he will give them thirty pieces of 
fine linen and garments.[6][13] The riddle ("Out of the eater, something to 
eat; out of the strong, something sweet") is a veiled account of his second 
encounter with the lion (at which only he was present).[6][7] The Philistines 
are infuriated by the riddle.[6] The thirty groomsmen tell Samson's new wife 
that they will burn her and her father's household if she does not discover the 
answer to the riddle and tell it to them.[6][7] At the urgent and tearful 
imploring of his bride, Samson tells her the solution, and she tells it to the 
thirty groomsmen.[6][13]

Before sunset on the seventh day they said to him,
"What is sweeter than honey?
and what is stronger than a lion?"
Samson said to them,
"If you had not plowed with my heifer,
you would not have solved my riddle."[9][14]
He flies into a rage and kills thirty Philistines of Ashkelon for their 
garments, which he gives his thirty groomsmen.[7][9][13] Still in a rage, he 
returns to his father's house and his bride is given to the best man as his 
wife.[7][9][13] Her father refuses to allow him to see her and wishes to give 
Samson the younger sister.[9][13] Samson attaches torches to the tails of three 
hundred foxes, leaving the panicked beasts to run through the fields of the 
Philistines, burning all in their wake.[7][9][13] The Philistines find out why 
Samson burned their crops and they burn Samson's wife and father-in-law to 
death.[8][9][13] In revenge, Samson slaughters many more Philistines, smiting 
them "hip and thigh".[9][13]
Samson then takes refuge in a cave in the rock of Etam.[9][13][15] An army of 
Philistines went up and demanded from 3000 men of Judah to deliver them 
Samson.[13][15] With Samson's consent, they tie him with two new ropes and are 
about to hand him over to the Philistines when he breaks free.[8][15] Using the 
jawbone of an ass, he slays one thousand Philistines.[4][8][15] At the 
conclusion of Judges 15 it is said that "Samson led Israel for twenty years in 
the days of the Philistines".[15]

Later, Samson goes to Gaza, where he stays at a harlot's house.[9][16] His 
enemies wait at the gate of the city to ambush him, but he rips the gate up and 
carries it to "the hill that is in front of Hebron".[9][16]
He then falls in love with a woman, Delilah, at the Brook of 
Sorek.[8][9][16][17] The Philistines approach Delilah and induce her (with 1100 
silver coins each) to try to find the secret of Samson's strength.[9][16] 
Samson, not wanting to reveal the secret, teases her, telling her that he will 
lose his strength should he be bound with fresh bowstrings.[9][16] She does so 
while he sleeps, but when he wakes up he snaps the strings.[9][16] She 
persists, and he tells her he can be bound with new ropes. She ties him up with 
new ropes while he sleeps, and he snaps them, too.[9][16] She asks again, and 
he says he can be bound if his locks are woven together.[9][16] She weaves them 
together, but he undoes them when he wakes.[9][16] Eventually Samson tells 
Delilah that he will lose his strength with the loss of his hair.[8][9][16][17] 
Delilah calls for a servant to shave Samson's seven locks.[9][16][17] Since 
that breaks the Nazirite oath, God leaves him, and Samson is captured by the 
Philistines,[4][9][16] who stab out his eyes with their swords. After being 
blinded, Samson is brought to Gaza, imprisoned, and put to work grinding 
grain.[16]
Samson destroys the temple of Dagon, 1890 Bible illustration
One day the Philistine leaders assemble in a temple for a religious sacrifice 
to Dagon, one of their most important deities, for having delivered Samson into 
their hands.[11][16] They summon Samson so that people can gather on the roof 
to watch.[11][16][17] Once inside the temple, Samson, his hair having grown 
long again, asks the servant who is leading him to the temple's central pillars 
if he may lean against them (referring to the pillars).[8][11][16]
"Then Samson prayed to God, "remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I 
pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the 
Philistines for my two eyes" (Judges 16:28)".[4][11][16] "Samson said, 'Let me 
die with the Philistines!' (Judges 16:30)[11][18] He pulled the two pillars 
together, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in 
it.[4][8][11][17][18] Thus he killed many more as he died than while he lived." 
(Judges 16:30).[8][18]
After his death, Samson's family recovers his body from the rubble and buries 
him near the tomb of his father Manoah.[11]
The fate of Delilah is never mentioned.[17]
